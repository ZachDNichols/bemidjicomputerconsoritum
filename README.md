# Bemidji Code Consortium
Website for CS2270 Final Project

"Our final project will be a coding blogging website. It will have a main homepage displaying the newest, most popular posts and other relevant information. We will also include another page that includes social links and an about us paragraph. We will design it with simple complementary colors and an elegant interface to make it very user-friendly."

# How to contribute effeciently

This will be the majority of what issues will be made. Please make a seperate branch in response to issues, and make sure to assign issues if you are taking them. If you can no longer take an issue, please remove yourself as the asignee. Feel free to add issues as you wish.
