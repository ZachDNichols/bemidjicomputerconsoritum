            <h1>How to Set Up a HTML Development Environment</h1>
            <p>Getting started with HTML is the best idea for those who are new to programming. As tough as it can seem it is 
                the programming language that requires the least amount of prior knowledge. In this guide, we will show you what you need to do set up a
                program to allow you to get on the path to coding. Whether it be a future occupation or a hobby. It is worth noting, we will only be going over
                <i>two</i> methods for installing a development environment. There are many ways to skin a cat, and these are two of those ways.
                For any operating system, setting up VS Code is not that complicated. The nice thing about
                setting up a program like VS Code is that once you do it you will not have to do it again &lpar;Unless you wipe your machine&rpar;.
            <br/><br/></p>

            <p>The main thing we need for writing our code is an Integrated Development Environment,
                and while there are lots out there ranging from extremely simple to incredibly powerful,
                we're going to use Visual Studio Code as it has a nice feature set, and is pretty simple to use.
                Just click the Visual Studio Code logo on the right to get access to the download page! The manual loding method involves loading the HTML file manually
                and refreshing each time you make changes to your HTML in VS code following steps below:
