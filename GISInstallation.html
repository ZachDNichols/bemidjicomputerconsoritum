                Installating - ArcGIS Pro
            </h1>
            <p>
                You will need some type of commercial software to work with Geo databases (.GDBs) There are free resources linked at the bottom of this page however,
                 for
                our purposes this tutorial will cover Esri's ArcGIS Pro (The leading technology any private organization you work for would mostlikely use.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Before installing any Esri products you <b>Must</b> have the required microsft framework (The Patches required to run Esri products are not currently available for Mac)

                Because ArcGIS Pro is an industry standard most businesses and universities (Not including the Forest/Park Serivce, and affiliated technical colleges)
                will provide you with credentials and a license.
