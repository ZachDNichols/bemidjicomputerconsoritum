            <h1>What <i>is</i> Python?</h1>
            <p>Python is a high level general-purpose programming language created by Guido can Rossum.
                It is currently the most popular computer language around for its simplistic
                design and ease of use. It was also named after the show Monty Python<br/> Source: <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Wikipedia</a></p>

            <h1>What is Python used for?</h1>
            <p>Python is used in tons of different industries including data analytics, AI and even website design. It is
                also used quite extensively as a scripting language to preform repetitive tasks. It is also used a lot
                in Universities to teach students about basic programing because of its simple setup 
                and ease to read syntax.

            <h1>Set up a Python Enviroment in VS Code</h1>
            <p>We will be going over how install and set up python enviroment on your computer. 
                
                This tutorial should will be focused on a windows machine but the steps are
                very similar if you are installing on a Mac. (NOTE - Mac Os comes with Python 2.7 pre-intalled, but we
                will be installing and using python 3)
            </p>
            <h3><b>Step 0</b> - Checking Python Version</h3>
            <p>Before we start it is smart to see if you already have 
                python installed on your system. To check if you already
                have it installed open a command promt on your machine. <br><br>
                Windows Shortcut - Windows Key + R then type "cmd" then Enter <br>
                Mac Shortcut - Cmd + Space <br> <br>
                Type this command and then enter.
                <blockquote>python --version</blockquote>
                This will return with either the lastest version of python
                that you have installed or will return not found. <br>
                <blockquote>C:\Users\Henri>python --version <br>
                    Python 3.10.1
                </blockquote>
                For this tutorial you will want atleast version 3.9. If you already
                have this version or newer installed you are all good and can 
                start progrmming! If you dont have a new version of Python
                or no version of python installed continue to Step 1.

            <h3><b>Step 1</b> - Downloading Python</h3>
            <p>To get started installing python go to their
                <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Offical Download Page</a>
                and download the latest version. The installer wizard will pop up and prompt 
                you to click the installation style you'd like. <br>
                <img src="python_usage_images/step1.png" alt="" id="step1img">
                <br>
                Make sure you click add python to PATH. This makes
                sure that python can be recongized anywhere in the system.
                After that click <i>Install Now</i><br><br>
                Congrats! Python is now installed. <br><br>
            </p>
            <h3><b>Step 2</b> - Downloading Visual Studio Code</h3>
            <p>
                Next we have to install Visual Studio Code (VS Code for short).
                First go to the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Offical Download Page</a>
                and install the correct version for you computer. Follow the 
                promts on the installation wizard.<br><br>
                Once installed open up VS Code and click this button on the left 
                hand side. <br>
                <img src="python_usage_images/step2.png" alt="" id="step2img"><br>
                This is the extensions menu. Here you can download many different extensiosn that
                will help you build faster and cleaner looking code. Search <i>python</i> in
                the text bar and install the first one by Microsoft. <br>
                <img src="python_usage_images/step2-1.png" alt="" id="step3img"><br>
                After you have the extension you are all set up and ready to start coding!
