            <h1>What <i>is</i> Python?</h1>
            <p>Python is a high level general-purpose programming language created by Guido can Rossum.
                It is currently the most popular computer language around for its simplistic
                design and ease of use. It was also named after the show Monty Python<br/> Source: <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Wikipedia</a></p>

        <div class = "pythonusedfor">
            <h1>What is Python used for?</h1>
            <p>Python is used in tons of different industries including data analytics, AI and even website design. It is
                also used quite extensively as a scripting language to preform repetitive tasks. It is also used a lot
                in Universities to teach students about basic programing because of its simple setup 
                and ease to read syntax.

            <h1>Set up a Python Enviroment in VS Code</h1>
            <p>We will be going over how install and set up python enviroment on your computer. 
                
                This tutorial should will be focused on a windows machine but the steps are
                very similar if you are installing on a Mac. (NOTE - Mac Os comes with Python 2.7 pre-intalled, but we
                will be installing and using python 3)
            </p>
            <h3><b>Step 0</b> - Checking Python Version</h3>
            <p>Before we start it is smart to see if you already have 
                python installed on your system. To check if you already
                have it installed open a command promt on your machine. <br><br>
                Windows Shortcut - Windows Key + R then type "cmd" then Enter <br>
                Mac Shortcut - Cmd + Space <br> <br>
                Type this command and then enter.
                <blockquote>python --version</blockquote>
                This will return with either the lastest version of python
                that you have installed or will return not found. <br>
                <blockquote>C:\Users\Henri>python --version <br>
                    Python 3.10.1
                </blockquote>
                For this tutorial you will want atleast version 3.9. If you already
                have this version or newer installed you are all good and can 
                start progrmming! If you dont have a new version of Python
                or no version of python installed continue to Step 1.
            </p><br>
            <h3><b>Step 1</b> - Downloading Python</h3>
            <p>To get started installing python go to their
                <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Offical Download Page</a>
                and download the latest version. The installer wizard will pop up and prompt 
                you to click the installation style you'd like. <br>
                <img src="python_usage_images/step1.png" alt="" id="step1img">
                <br>
                Make sure you click add python to PATH. This makes
                sure that python can be recongized anywhere in the system.
                After that click <i>Install Now</i><br><br>
                Congrats! Python is now installed. <br><br>
            </p>
            <h3><b>Step 2</b> - Downloading Visual Studio Code</h3>
            <p>
                Next we have to install Visual Studio Code (VS Code for short).
                First go to the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Offical Download Page</a>
                and install the correct version for you computer. Follow the 
                promts on the installation wizard.<br><br>
                Once installed open up VS Code and click this button on the left 
                hand side. <br>
                <img src="python_usage_images/step2.png" alt="" id="step2img"><br>
                This is the extensions menu. Here you can download many different extensiosn that
                will help you build faster and cleaner looking code. Search <i>python</i> in
                the text bar and install the first one by Microsoft. <br>
                <img src="python_usage_images/step2-1.png" alt="" id="step2-2img"><br>
                After you have the extension you are all set up and ready to start coding!
        
            </p>
            <h3><b>Step 3</b> - Making a Basic Program</h3>
            <p>Here we are going to make a couple of basic programs so you can get an idea of how python works
                <br>First, click the file dropdown at the top left of the page and click new text file.
            </p>
            <img src="python_usage_images/step3.png" alt="" id="step3img">
            <p>We will then click the link that says,"Select a language". This will
                open up a dialogue box that allows you select whatever programming 
                language you want. We will type "python" and hit enter.
                Then do control ctrl+s to save it. Give the file what ever name you like.
                You'll notice that the file ends in .py. That means its a python file. <br><br>
                Now we can start coding! To start lets make a program that prints a simple "Hello, World"
                <blockquote>
                    print("Hello, World!")
                </blockquote>
                The code above will print the message "Hello, World!" to the terminal. <br>
                <br> <img src="python_usage_images/step3-2.png" alt="" id="step3-2img"><br><br>
                Note - If your code doesn't print its possible you don't have the terminal open
                to open. It open it go to the top nav bar and click View and then make sure terminal is checked.
                <br> <br>Lets quickly look into the print function and talk about how it works.
                When the print function is called it looks at the content inside the 
                parentheses and makes sure its a string. A string is defined when text
                is inside quotation marks. It then takes this input and displays it
                on the terminal page.
            </p>
            <h4><b>Step 4</b> - Basic Logic</h4>
            <p>
                Python also has basic logic that allows you to add,
                subtract, multiply, and divide. Below are some examples
                of how to perform these operations.
                <blockquote>
                    print(2+2)   #4 <br>
                    print(2-1)   #1  <br>
                    print(4*3)   #12 <br>
                    print(10/5)  #2 <br>
                </blockquote>
                You can ignore the # as its used to comment in python. It
                is just being used to show you the expected output.
            <br><br>
            You can also create varibles by using the syntax: varibleName = value. 
            Below is an example of it in python.
            <blockquote>
                age = 4    <br>
                print(age)
            </blockquote>
            This allows you to save data in varibles that can be used later in your
            program.
            <br><br>
