            <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Danish 
                computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the 
                C programming language, or "C with Classes".<br/> Source: <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">Wikipedia</a></p>

            <h1>What is C++ used for?</h1>
            <p>C++ is used for a variety of many modern applications. C++ is even used
                in the web browser you are viewing this on! C++ is also used for things like game engines,
                proffesional applications such as the Adobe suite, or even operating systems! Take a look at some of the images below to see what
                popular applications use C++.

            <h1>How to Set Up a C++ Development Environment</h1>
            <p>Getting started with C++ can be a rather daunting task at first, especially if you are
                coming from a language such as Python, which needs virtually no set-up required at all.
                Sadly, C++, unlike Python, cannot be interpretted at runtime. In order to actually execute your C++ code, you need something
                called a <u>compiler</u>. There are many C++ code compilers available, and there are different ones to choose from
                depending on your operating system. How do you know which one to use? In this guide, we will show you what you need to do set up a 
                compiler for C++ on either Windows or Mac.
            </p>
            <h2>Setting up C++ Development on Windows</h2>
            <p>For the Windows operating system, setting up a comiler is not that complicated. The nice thing about
                setting up a compiler is that once you do it you will not have to do it again &lpar;Unless you wipe your machine&rpar;.
                In this tutorial, we will use Windows 11, but it will be a very similar process for Windows 10 as well.
            </p>

            <h2>Setting up C++ Development on MacOS</h2>
            <p>Just like the Windows operating system, setting up a C++ compiler is not that hard.
                It can actually be easier in some regards if you already have Xcode (an IDE created by Apple). 
                In this tutorial, we will be using MacOS Monterey 12.6, but it should work for future versions of MacOS.
                If you run into errors, try using an older version of <a class="XcodeLink" href="https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=xcode">Xcode</a>.
