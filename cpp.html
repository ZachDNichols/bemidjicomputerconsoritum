            <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Danish 
                computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the 
                C programming language, or "C with Classes".<br/> Source: <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">Wikipedia</a></p>

            <h1>What is C++ used for?</h1>
            <p>C++ is used for a variety of many modern applications. C++ is even used
                in the web browser you are viewing this on! C++ is also used for things like game engines,
                proffesional applications such as the Adobe suite, or even operating systems! Take a look at some of the images below to see what
                popular applications use C++.

            <h1>How to Set Up a C++ Development Environment</h1>
            <p>Getting started with C++ can be a rather daunting task at first, especially if you are
                coming from a language such as Python, which needs virtually no set-up required at all.
                Sadly, C++, unlike Python, cannot be interpretted at runtime. In order to actually execute your C++ code, you need something
                called a <u>compiler</u>. There are many C++ code compilers available, and there are different ones to choose from
                depending on your operating system. How do you know which one to use? In this guide, we will show you what you need to do set up a 
                compiler for C++ on either Windows or Mac. It is worth noting, we will only be going over <i>one</i> method for installing a development environment for each platform.
                There are many ways to skin a cat, and this is one of those ways.
            </p>
            <h2>Setting up C++ Development on Windows</h2>
            <p>For the Windows operating system, setting up a comiler is not that complicated. The nice thing about
                setting up a compiler is that once you do it you will not have to do it again &lpar;Unless you wipe your machine&rpar;.
                In this tutorial, we will use Windows 11, but it will be a very similar process for Windows 10 as well.
            </p>
            <h3><b>Step One</b> - Download Visual Studio Code</h3>
            <a href = "https://code.visualstudio.com/"><img src = "cpptutorial/vscode logo.png" alt = "Download Visual Studio Code" title = "Download Visual Studio Code"></a>
            <p>The main thing we need for writing our C++ code is an Integrated Development Environment,
                and while there are lots out there ranging from extremely simple to incredibly powerful,
                we're going to use Visual Studio Code as it has a nice feature set, and is pretty simple to use.
                Just click the Visual Studio Code logo on the right to get access to the download page!
                <br/><br/>
            </p>
            <h3><b>Step 2</b> - Get the C++ Extensions</h3>
            <img src = "winCPPcompiler/1.png" alt = "Click the extensions button" title = "Navigate to the extensions tab">
            <p>The nice thing about Visual Studio Code, is that you can accessorize it with various extensions.
                For this tutorial, we will be using the extensions needed for C++. These extensions will add things like Intellisense,
                support for C++ as whole, and more! To do this, we will navigate to the extension panel.
            </p>
            <img src = "winCPPcompiler/2.png" alt = "Searching for and installing the C++ extension pack" title = "Searching for and installing the C++ extension pack">
            <p>We will want to search for the C++ extension pack created by Microsoft. This will let us have access to
                helpful features like C++ support, and Intellisense.</p>
            <img src = "winCPPcompiler/3.png" alt = "Creating the template directory" title = "Creating the template directory">
            <p>Next, we are going to create a directory for our project template. This will allow us
                to reuse the same folder for future C++ programs we choose to create.</p>
            <img src = "winCPPcompiler/4.png" alt = "Downloading the compile executables" title = "Downloading the compile executables">
            <p>Go to this <a href = "https://winlibs.com/">website</a>. Here, download the .zip file for the compilers.
            Depending on if your operating system is 32 or 64 bit will determine which one you should download.
            Make sure to download the first option.</p>

            

            <h2>Setting up C++ Development on MacOS</h2>
            <p>Just like the Windows operating system, setting up a C++ compiler is not that hard.
                It can actually be easier in some regards if you already have Xcode (an IDE created by Apple). 
                In this tutorial, we will be using MacOS Monterey 12.6, but it should work for future versions of MacOS.
                If you run into errors, try using an older version of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=xcode" title = "Apple developer website">Xcode</a>.
            </p>
            <h3><b>Step One</b> - Download Visual Studio Code</h3>
            <a href = "https://code.visualstudio.com/"><img src = "cpptutorial/vscode logo.png" alt = "Download Visual Studio Code" title = "Download Visual Studio Code"></a>
            <p>The main thing we need for writing our C++ code is an Integrated Development Environment,
                and while there are lots out there ranging from extremely simple to incredibly powerful,
                we're going to use Visual Studio Code as it has a nice feature set, and is pretty simple to use.
                Just click the Visual Studio Code logo on the right to get access to the download page!
                <br/><br/>
            </p>
            <h3><b>Step Two</b> - Get the C++ Extension</h3>
            <img src = "winCPPcompiler/1.png" alt = "Click the extensions button" title = "Navigate to the extensions tab">
            <p>The nice thing about Visual Studio Code, is that you can accessorize it with various extensions.
                For this tutorial, we will be using the extensions needed for C++. These extensions will add things like Intellisense,
                support for C++ as whole, and more! To do this, we will navigate to the extension panel.</p>
            <img src = "vscodecppextensions/step1.png" alt = "Click the extensions button" title = "Navigate to the extensions tab">
            <p>Once we navigate to the extension panel, we want to search for "C++" in the search bar. We want to click on the extension
                called "C++ Extension Pack" by Microsoft.</p>
            <img src = "vscodecppextensions/step2.png" alt = "Searching for the C++ extension pack" title = "Searching for the C++ extension pack">
            <p>After that, we want to click the "Install" button. This should only take a few seconds.</p>
            <img src = "vscodecppextensions/step3.png" alt = "Installing the C++ extension pack" title = "Installing the C++ extension pack">
            <p>The next step for us to do after installing the extensions is to download the Clang compiler for MacOS. There are a couple ways to do this, but probably the easiest way
                to do this is to install Xcode.
            </p>
                
            <p></p>
            <h3><b>Step Three</b> - Download the Clang Compiler (Xcode)</h3>
            <img src = "/cpptutorial/1.png">
            <p>Xcode can either be downloaded from the Mac App Store, or it can be downloaded from the <a href= "https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=xcode" title = "Apple developer website">Apple Developer Website</a>.
            This is probably the easiest and most common way people acquired the Clang compiler. If you don't want to download Xcode, you can find instructions for downloading
            and setting up the standalone Clang compiler <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/common/handouts/macclion/clang.html" title = "How to set up standalone Clang compiler">here</a>.</p>
            <h3><b>Step 4</b> - Create a Template Directory</h3>
            <p>To avoid having to set up the Clang compiler inside of VS code multiple times, it is a good idea to set up a template directory we want to use
                to create our future C++ projects in.</p>
            <img src = "macCPPcompiler/1.png" alt = "Creating a template folder for VS code C++ projects" title = "Creating a template folder for VS code C++ projects">
            <p>The first thing we need to do is create our template directory. We are just going to call this "VS Code Template Directory",
                but you can name this whatever you want.</p>
            <img src = "macCPPcompiler/2.png" alt = "Open template folder inside of Visual Studio Code" title = "Open template folder inside of Visual Studio Code">
            <p>The next thing we are going to do is open up Visual Studio Code, and then open that new folder we just
                created inside of Visual Studio code.</p>
            <img src = "macCPPcompiler/3.png" alt = "Trust the author of the folder" title = "Trust the author of the folder">
            <p>You may get a prompt from Visual Studio similar to this asking if you wish to trust the authors. This is a security
                feature built into Visual Studio Code, and is there in the event you may accidentally download malicious code from the web.
                In this instance, since we are the author and creator of the folder, we are going to click "Trust".</p>
            <img src = "macCPPcompiler/4.png" alt = "Create new main.cpp file" title = "Create new main.cpp file">
            <p>Now that we are inside of folder in Visual Studio Code, we need to create our main.cpp file.
                To do this, we are going to click the "Create File" button at the top of our template folder.</p>
            <img src = "macCPPcompiler/5.png" alt = "New C++ file was created." title = "New C++ file was created">
            <p>As you can see, a new C++ file was created inside of the folder. If it does not open automatically, you will
                want to click on the file to open it in the editor.</p>
            <img src = "macCPPcompiler/6.png" alt = "Writing our main function in the main.cpp file" title = "Writing our main function in the main.cpp file">
            <p>Inside of our editor, we are going to write a simple "Hello World" program to test that our C++ compiler is functioning properly. 
                In the editor, we are going to write the following: 
<pre class = "cpppre">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World";

    return 0;
}
</pre>
            </p>
            <img src = "macCPPcompiler/7.png" alt = "Clicking the Configure Tasks button" title = "Clicking the Configure Tasks button">
            <p>After we have typed out our main function, we are then going to click Terminal in the menu bar, and then click the
                "Configure Tasks" button.</p>
            <img src = "macCPPcompiler/8.png" alt = "Clicking the clang++ option" title = "Clicking the clang++ option">
            <p>After that we will have a menu appear. This will show us the available "tasks" we can perform.
                Because we want to build a C++ file with Clang, we are going to click the "clang++" option.</p>
            <img src = "macCPPcompiler/9.png" alt = "taks.json file created" title = "taks.json file created">
            <p>This will create a tasks.json file for the code editor to use to compile our code. If you wish to learn more about the
                different parameters you can select, you can read this <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-clang-mac">documentation</a>
                from Microsoft for more information.</p>
            <img src = "macCPPcompiler/10.png" alt = "Compiling the C++ code" title = "Compiling the C++ code">
            <p>After we do this, we are going to navigate back to our C++ file and click the run button. It is important to note,
                if you see the run button with the bug icon on it, you need to click the drop-down menu to the right and click the
                "run default tasks" option.</p>
            <img src = "macCPPcompiler/11.png" alt = "Click the Clang++ option" title = "Click the Clang++ option">
            <p>This will show a new menu in the editor. You will want to click the "Clang++" option, and the compiler will run.</p>
            <img src = "macCPPcompiler/12.png" alt = "Message from compiler in the terminal showing a successful build" title = "Message from compiler in the terminal showing a successful build">
            <p>You will see confirmation in the terminal if your program compiled successfully, or if it had errors. You should not have any errors
                in this instance, as the code has been tested and works. If you have errors, you may want start this guide from the beginning.</p>
            <img src = "macCPPcompiler/13.png" alt = "Open a new terminal in VS Code" title = "Open a new terminal in VS Code">
            <p>To run our newly compiled program, we need to open a new terminal. To do this, click "Terminal" in the menu bar, and click "New Terminal".</p>
            <img src = "macCPPcompiler/14.png" alt = "Type ./main in the terminal" title = "Type ./main in the terminal">
            <p>This will open a new terminal in VS Code at the bottom. In the terminal, we will want to execute the executable file we just created.
                We will do this by typing "./main".</p>
            <img src = "macCPPcompiler/15.png" alt = "Hello World! output in terminal" title = "Hello World! output in terminal">
            <p>You will see the output from the program in the terminal. Since all our program does is print "Hello World!", that is all that is output.</p>
