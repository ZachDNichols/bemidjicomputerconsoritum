            <h1>What <i>is</i> C++?</h1>
            <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Danish 
                computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the 
                C programming language, or "C with Classes".<br/> Source: <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">Wikipedia</a></p>

            <h1>Why it is important?</h1>
            <p>C++ is one of the most popular coding languages in the world right now, and it is based off another language called C.
                C++ is significant because it is a low-level language, and is one of the most popular low level languages out there.
                Unline Python or C#, C++ can talk and interact more close to the hardware itself, instead of operating in a virtual machine
                like the former two. With it's ability to reference specific points in memory, you can create diverse programs that execute
                quickly, or programs that blow everything up and cause memory errors. It is important to use C++ with care, as it has the potential to
                do a lot.
