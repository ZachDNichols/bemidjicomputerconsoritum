         <h1>What are the uses of Python?</h1>
         <p>Python is used for a wide variety of applications! Its used most
            commonly to do things such as machine learning, basic scripting and data analysis. 
            Python is also typically taught to students as their first computer language because of its simplicity.
         </p>
         <br>
         <h2>&nbsp;1. Machine Learning </h2>
         <p>Python is the most common language used for machine learning and artificial intelligence.
            Python is popular among the comunity because it doesn't have to be compiled and it combines with other languages quite seamlessly.
            There are also many libraries made for Python machine learning such as SciKit, TensorFlow, and Keras. 
         </p>

         <h2>&nbsp;2. Basic Scripting</h2>
         <p>Python is also commonly used for basic scripting in different frameworks such as Django, Tornado and Flask. It is also common used as a scripting language in many 3d animation softwares such as 3DS Max, Blender and Cinema 4d.</p>
         <h2>&nbsp;3. Data Analysis</h2>
         <p>Python is also commonly used for scientific computing and data analysis. Although python its self isn't a good language for big data 
            it is good at combining libraries. So commonly researchers use libraries such as Pandas, NumPy and SciPy to complete the calculations. Then graphing libraries such as MatPlotLib to display the calculated data.
