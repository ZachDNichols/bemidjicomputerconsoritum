            <h1>What is GIS?</h1>
            <p>
                A Geographic Information System, or GIS for short, is a computer
                system that analyzes and displays geographically referenced information. It uses data
                that is attatched to a unique location. GIS has many implications,
                especially in earth sciences and biology. It is a computer software
                that requires no coding experience and bridges the gap between earth sciences and computer science.  <br> <u>Source:</u> <a href = https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-geographic-information-system-gis#:~:text=A%20Geographic%20Information%20System%20(GIS)%20is%20a%20computer%20system%20that,Where%20are%20USGS%20streamgages%20located%3F>USGS.gov</a>

            <h1>What are its uses?</h1>
            <p>
                GIS technology is often used to conduct scientific investigations,
                manage resources, as well as aid in development planning. According to
                <a href = https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/geographic-information-system-gis>National Geographic</a>;
                many retail businesses will use GIS software to help them determine where to locate a
                new store. Marketing companies will use GIS to decide to whom to market stores and resturaunts
                , as well as where that marketing should be.
