            <h1>What is C++ used for?</h1>
            C++ is used for a variety of many modern applications. C++ is even used
            in the web browser you are viewing this on! C++ is also used for things like game engines,
            proffesional applications such as the Adobe suite, or even operating systems! Take a look at some of the images below to see what
            popular applications use C++.
            <br><br>
            <h1>&nbsp;1. GUI-based Applications</h1>
            C++ can be used to develop most of the GUI-based and desktop applications easily as it has got the required features.
            Most of the applications of the adobe systems including Illustrator, Photoshop, etc. are developed using C++.
            Win amp media player from Microsoft is popular software that has been catering to all our audio/video needs for decades now. This software is developed in C++.

            <h1>&nbsp;2. Games</h1>
            C++ is close to the hardware, can easily manipulate resources, provide procedural programming over CPU-intensive functions, and is fast. 
            It is also able to override the complexities of 3D games and provides multilayer networking.
            All these benefits of C++ make it a primary choice to develop gaming systems as well as game development suites.
            <h1>&nbsp;3. Database Software</h1>
            C++ is also used in writing database management software. The two most popular databases MySQL and Postgres are written in C++.
            MySQL, one of the most popular database software that is used widely in many real-world applications are written in C++.
            This is the world's most popular open-source database. This database is written in C++ and is used by most organizations.
