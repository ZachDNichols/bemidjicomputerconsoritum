            <h1>What are the uses of HTML?</h1>
            <p>The HyperText Markup Language is heavily utilized for creating web pages, such as the one you are using right now!
                It is also used to develop web applications, and when combining HTML with other programming laguages such as
                JavaScript and CSS, have created milestones for web development.
                <br><br>
                <h2>1. Web Page Development</h2>
                    HTML is mainly used for creating pages that are displayed on the web. Every single page we see on the internet
                    is written using a version of HTML code. 
                    <br><img src="https://www.creatopy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/HTML5-benefits.jpg">
                <h2>2. Internet Navigaion</h2>
                    One of the most important uses of HTML is creating pages that are able to be navigated.
                    HTML uses hypertext to reference other pages or text, and when the user clicks it, it would navigate 
                    them to the referenced page. This is displayed with the navigation bar and various links found on this site!
                    They use HTML references in order to take you different places.
                <h2>3. Images on Web Pages</h2>
                    Another useful thing we can do with HTML is add images to web pages. We can use the img element in HTML
                    and a source to a picture from the web in order to fully control how an image is rendered on the site.
